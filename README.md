## About Me

I'm a **Security Specialist** and **Lead Secops Engineer** with a passion for **Digital Forensics & Incident Response (DFIR)**, **SIEM engineering**, and **Python-driven automation**.
I thrive on uncovering digital traces, improving detection workflows, and turning complex problems into actionable insights.

Beyond the blue team, I explore the human side of security through **social engineering** — including **phishing**, **vishing**, and **mystery guest** engagements — to help organizations strengthen their awareness and resilience.

## Core Areas of Expertise

- **DFIR & Threat Hunting** – Evidence collection, triage, forensic analysis, and post-incident review
- **SOC Operations & Coordination** – Incident management, playbook design, and process optimization
- **SIEM Engineering** – Detection logic, correlation rules, and alert tuning
- **Python & Automation** – Custom tooling for analysis, enrichment, and reporting
- **Social Engineering** – Phishing, vishing, and mystery-guest engagements

## Resources & Tools

I maintain a curated collection of resources, tools, and links I regularly use during **OSINT**, **threat analysis**, and **engagements**.
