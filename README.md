## 🧠 About Me

I'm a **Security Specialist** and **SOC Coordinator** with a passion for **Digital Forensics & Incident Response (DFIR)**, **SIEM engineering**, and **Python-driven automation**.  
I thrive on uncovering digital traces, improving detection workflows, and turning complex problems into actionable insights.

Beyond the blue team, I explore the human side of security through **social engineering** — including **phishing**, **vishing**, and **mystery guest** engagements — to help organizations strengthen their awareness and resilience.
